# Readme: Simple Calculator

## Introduction

This is a JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates how to create a simple calculator that performs basic mathematical operations.

## Functionality

The calculator has four buttons: **Add, Subtract, Divide, and Multiply**. These functions take two arguments **num1 and num2** and perform the corresponding mathematical operation. When the user clicks on one of the buttons, the corresponding function is called with **num1 and num2** as arguments. The result of the calculation is then rendered **Result:** .
For example, if the user clicks on the "Plus" button with num1 = 4 and num2 = 1, the add() function is called and the result (5) is rendered to the **Result:** .

## Usage
You can customize the values of num1 and num2 inside _index.js_ from the code to perform different calculations.

## Conclusion

This code snippet demonstrates a simple way to create a calculator that performs basic mathematical operations. You can extend this code to handle more complex calculations or add more features to your calculator.
