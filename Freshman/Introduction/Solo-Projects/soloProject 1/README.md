# Basketball Scoreboard

This is a simple basketball scoreboard that can be used to track the score of a game between two teams. The scoreboard has two sections, one for the home team and one for the guest team. Each section has a field for the team name, the score, and the number of timeouts remaining.

The scoreboard also has a section for the timeouts. This section has a field for the team that has the timeout, the number of timeouts remaining, and the time remaining in the timeout.

To use the scoreboard, simply enter the team names, scores, and timeouts. The scoreboard will automatically update the score and timeouts as the game progresses.
